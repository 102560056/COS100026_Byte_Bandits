Scenario:  
An  IT  company  wants  to  develop  a  website  that  will  enable  it  to  advertise  vacant  positions.  These 
have a ‘position description’ that sets out the qualifications, skills and knowledge required. Potential 
applicants for the position will be able to submit an online form to apply for a position.    
 
In  this  assignment  you  will  develop  a  prototype  of  this  website.  The  website  you  develop  will 
consist of the following Web pages, accessible from a common menu on each page: 
  
•  Home page with details of the company (index.html) 
•  A page of job descriptions (jobs.html) 
•  A job application page (apply.html) 
•  A page with your group details (about.html) 
•  A page which lists any enhancements  
you have made (enhancements.html) 
 
You will also include 
•  A CSS file that styles your website (style.css). 

The essential requirements for this assignment are listed in the marking guide. In general the web 
pages must: 
•  have relevant content  
•  must include the HTML markup specified in the marking guide  
•  must validate to HTML5 without errors  
•  must be styled by a validated CSS3 file  
•  must be linked to each other via a menu 
•  must be deployed on Mercury.  

All web pages in your website should have a consistent layout and navigation. Where “in-house” 
templates have been defined in this unit (e.g. for meta-data; tables; etc.) these should be followed. 
These include accessibility alternatives.  
The HTML in your Web pages must validate against the W3C HTML5 validator 
(http://validator.w3.org/nu) .  
Pages should not contain any deprecated elements/attributes (e.g. <i> , <b>). Do not use iframe 
elements in your assignment. 
Note: Generic structural elements like div or span should only be used where there is no more 
meaningful HTML5 element (e.g. section) that is appropriate.

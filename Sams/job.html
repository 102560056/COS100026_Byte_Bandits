<!-- You need to write a web page with at least 2 position descriptions. For one of these your tutor will 
allocate you a job title from the IT industry. For the second position, the choice of IT job type is 
entirely up to you. Why not write a position for the ideal job you would like to do? Be as imaginative 
as you like.  
 
The HTML on this page must contain: 
• Hierarchically structured headings of at least 2 levels 
• More than one <section> 
• An <aside> with appropriate content  
• At least one ordered list 
• At least one unordered list 
• The page should also have an appropriate footer. 
 
Your job descriptions should be concise but as a minimum include : 
• Company’s position description reference number (5  alphanumeric characters) 
• Position title  
• Brief description of the position 
• Salary range 
• The title of the position to whom the successful applicant will report  
• Key responsibilities.  A  list of the specific tasks that are to be performed 
• Required qualifications, skills, knowledge and attributes. These should be divided into 
“essential” and “preferable”. These requirements should include such things as 
programming languages required, number-of-years of experience required, etc.. 
  
 
The content of the job description should be appropriately structured with headings, sections, 
subsections, lists etc. using the appropriate HTML elements.  
 
Sources / References: 
• You can use material from other websites but the source of all material must be 
acknowledged. This acknowledgement should be immediately after the material 
and include a hyperlinked URL to the original source. The text of the hyperlink 
reference can be a short name but the hyperlink must work. 
• If you are unsure of what is contained in a position description there are many 
resources on the web. Here is one: http://recruitloop.com/blog/how-to-write-a-

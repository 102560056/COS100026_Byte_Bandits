/* 5. CSS Requirements 
No style markup should be included in your HTML file. 
The pages in your website must be styled with CSS and have a consistent ‘look and feel’, particularly 
common elements such as menus, headers and footers. While the emphasis is this assignment is on 
the appropriate application of techniques rather than graphic design, your pages should follow 
basic usability / accessibility principles, e.g. distinguishable foreground and background colours, and 
font readability, etc.   
 
Create your own design and implement it using one single external stylesheet that applies to all 
your Web pages. This file should be named style.css and placed in a styles folder on the server.  
The stylesheet should style the common elements on all your web pages, and address the following 
specific style requirements. 
 

2. Selectors: All the following CSS Selectors should be used appropriately at some point in this 
assignment: 
• element, #id, .class, grouping, contextual 
• pseudo class, pseudo element  
3. Menu: The menu should have its own set of styles applied. Use a background colour. 
4. Index Page: Demonstrated the following specific CSS rules on the index.html page: 
• display a background graphic. 
  


7. All pages:  should have a fluid layout (the page should “Reflow” on page resize). 
 
Other CSS selectors and properties can be used  as  necessary  and appropriate  for the 
presentation 
Do not include any proprietary CSS mark-up, such as –moz- or –webkit  etc. */


/* 1. Comments: The CSS should include comments at the beginning of the CSS file to identify 
author and purpose. Individual line comments should be used as necessary to explain 
particular styles and explain where they are applied.  */
